    **License:** This codebase is released under Apache 2.0 license and all models are released under the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license.

## **Introduction**

We are excited to announce that we have rebranded to **OpenAudio** - introducing a brand new series of advanced Text-to-Speech models that builds upon the foundation of Fish-Speech with significant improvements and new capabilities.

**Openaudio-S1-mini**: [Video](To Be Uploaded); [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini);

**Fish-Speech v1.5**: [Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EKiDYBE4o/); [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/fish-speech-1.5);

## **Highlights** âœ¨

### **Emotion Control**
OpenAudio S1 **supports a variety of emotional, tone, and special markers** to enhance speech synthesis:

- **Basic emotions**:
```
(angry) (sad) (excited) (surprised) (satisfied) (delighted) 
(scared) (worried) (upset) (nervous) (frustrated) (depressed)
(empathetic) (embarrassed) (disgusted) (moved) (proud) (relaxed)
(grateful) (confident) (interested) (curious) (confused) (joyful)
```

- **Advanced emotions**:
```
(disdainful) (unhappy) (anxious) (hysterical) (indifferent) 
(impatient) (guilty) (scornful) (panicked) (furious) (reluctant)
(keen) (disapproving) (negative) (denying) (astonished) (serious)
(sarcastic) (conciliative) (comforting) (sincere) (sneering)
(hesitating) (yielding) (painful) (awkward) (amused)
```

- **Tone markers**:
```
(in a hurry tone) (shouting) (screaming) (whispering) (soft tone)
```

- **Special audio effects**:
```
(laughing) (chuckling) (sobbing) (crying loudly) (sighing) (panting)
(groaning) (crowd laughing) (background laughter) (audience laughing)
```

You can also use Ha,ha,ha to control, there's many other cases waiting to be explored by yourself.

### **Excellent TTS quality**

We use Seed TTS Eval Metrics to evaluate the model performance, and the results show that OpenAudio S1 achieves **0.008 WER** and **0.004 CER** on English text, which is significantly better than previous models. (English, auto eval, based on OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe, speaker distance using Revai/pyannote-wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM)

| Model | Word Error Rate (WER) | Character Error Rate (CER) | Speaker Distance |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **S1** | **0.008**  | **0.004**  | **0.332** |
| **S1-mini** | **0.011** | **0.005** | **0.380** |

### **Two Type of Models**

| Model | Size | Availability | Features |
|-------|------|--------------|----------|
| **S1** | 4B parameters | Avaliable on [fish.audio](fish.audio) | Full-featured flagship model |
| **S1-mini** | 0.5B parameters | Avaliable on huggingface [hf space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini) | Distilled version with core capabilities |

Both S1 and S1-mini incorporate online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

## **Features**

1. **Zero-shot & Few-shot TTS:** Input a 10 to 30-second vocal sample to generate high-quality TTS output. **For detailed guidelines, see [Voice Cloning Best Practices](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/voice-clone-best-practices).**

2. **Multilingual & Cross-lingual Support:** Simply copy and paste multilingual text into the input boxâ€”no need to worry about the language. Currently supports English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.

3. **No Phoneme Dependency:** The model has strong generalization capabilities and does not rely on phonemes for TTS. It can handle text in any language script.

4. **Highly Accurate:** Achieves a low CER (Character Error Rate) of around 0.4% and WER (Word Error Rate) of around 0.8% for Seed-TTS Eval.

5. **Fast:** With fish-tech acceleration, the real-time factor is approximately 1:5 on an Nvidia RTX 4060 laptop and 1:15 on an Nvidia RTX 4090.

6. **WebUI Inference:** Features an easy-to-use, Gradio-based web UI compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers.

7. **GUI Inference:** Offers a PyQt6 graphical interface that works seamlessly with the API server. Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS. [See GUI](https://github.com/AnyaCoder/fish-speech-gui).

8. **Deploy-Friendly:** Easily set up an inference server with native support for Linux, Windows (MacOS comming soon), minimizing speed loss.
