## Fish Agent
We are very excited to annoce that we have made our self-research agent demo open source, you can now try our agent demo online at [demo](https://fish.audio/demo/live) for instant English chat and English and Chinese chat locally by following the [docs](https://speech.fish.audio/start_agent/).

You should mention that the content is released under a **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence**. And the demo is an early alpha test version, the inference speed needs to be optimised, and there are a lot of bugs waiting to be fixed. If you've found a bug or want to fix it, we'd be very happy to receive an issue or a pull request.

## Features
### Fish Speech

1. **Zero-shot & Few-shot TTS:** Input a 10 to 30-second vocal sample to generate high-quality TTS output. **For detailed guidelines, see [Voice Cloning Best Practices](https://docs.fish.audio/text-to-speech/voice-clone-best-practices).**

2. **Multilingual & Cross-lingual Support:** Simply copy and paste multilingual text into the input boxâ€”no need to worry about the language. Currently supports English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.

3. **No Phoneme Dependency:** The model has strong generalization capabilities and does not rely on phonemes for TTS. It can handle text in any language script.

4. **Highly Accurate:** Achieves a low CER (Character Error Rate) and WER (Word Error Rate) of around 2% for 5-minute English texts.

5. **Fast:** With fish-tech acceleration, the real-time factor is approximately 1:5 on an Nvidia RTX 4060 laptop and 1:15 on an Nvidia RTX 4090.

6. **WebUI Inference:** Features an easy-to-use, Gradio-based web UI compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers.

7. **GUI Inference:** Offers a PyQt6 graphical interface that works seamlessly with the API server. Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS. [See GUI](https://github.com/AnyaCoder/fish-speech-gui).

8. **Deploy-Friendly:** Easily set up an inference server with native support for Linux, Windows and MacOS, minimizing speed loss.

### Fish Agent
1. **Completely End to End:** Automatically integrates ASR and TTS parts, no need to plug-in other models, i.e., true end-to-end, not three-stage (ASR+LLM+TTS).

2. **Timbre Control:** Can use reference audio to control the speech timbre. 

3. **Emotional:** The model can generate speech with strong emotion.
